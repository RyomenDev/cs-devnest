# AetherAI

AetherAI is an innovative web-based project that blends object detection, augmented reality (AR), and immersive experiences to create interactive educational and entertainment applications. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, AetherAI leverages cutting-edge technologies such as TensorFlow, Unsplash API, and A-Frame to deliver unique experiences.

## Features

### 1. Object Detection with TensorFlow

AetherAI uses TensorFlow.js to detect and identify objects in real-time. Once an object is detected, the Unsplash API is called to retrieve and display a relevant image of the detected object. This feature is designed to enhance the user's understanding by providing visual references for the identified objects.

### 2. Augmented Reality Alphabet Learning

AetherAI incorporates Augmented Reality (AR) using A-Frame and A-Frame Extras to create an engaging learning environment for children. The AR feature identifies alphabet markers and displays corresponding 3D models and images. This interactive approach helps children learn the alphabet in a fun and immersive way.

### 3. AR Music Player

The AR music player in AetherAI uses markers to trigger and play different music genres. This feature allows users to explore various music genres by interacting with AR markers, providing an innovative way to enjoy music.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Core technologies for structuring and styling the web pages.
- **TensorFlow.js:** For real-time object detection and identification.
- **Unsplash API:** To fetch images corresponding to detected objects.
- **A-Frame & A-Frame Extras:** For creating augmented reality experiences.
- **Bootstrap & Tailwind:** For responsive design and UI components.
