### Dividing your HomePage into multiple components improves readability, modularity, and maintainability. Here's how we can break down the HomePage:

#### 1. CategoryFilter Component:

###### Responsible for rendering the category and subcategory filter UI.

#### 2. ProductGrid Component:

###### Responsible for rendering the grid of products.

#### 3. ProductCard Component:

###### Individual card component to display product details.

#### 4. HomePage:

###### The main component that manages state and handles the logic of fetching products.

## Explanation:

<b>CategoryFilter.jsx:</b> Handles the sidebar for categories and subcategories selection.
<b>ProductCard.jsx:</b> Displays individual product details in a card format.
<b>ProductGrid.jsx:</b> Renders a grid of ProductCard components.
<b>HomePage.jsx:</b> Manages fetching products and coordinating between components (CategoryFilter and ProductGrid).
