JSON Server is an easy and quick-to-set-up module that you can use to fake or mock an API. You can find the basics in the documentation, and many articles regurgitate the same info. In this post, though, I intend to cover a few of the more complex things you can do with JSON Server.

React is a library for building user interface

it runs on the client as SPA(single page app),but can be used to build stack apps by communicating with a server(eg.MERN stack)

react is often referred to as a front-end "framework" because it is capable and directly comparable to a framwork such as Angular or vue.
